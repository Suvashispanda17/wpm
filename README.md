🚀✨ Speed Typing Test with Python! 🚀✨

Super excited to share my latest project: a Speed Typing Test program built in Python! 🐍 This console-based app challenges users to type a randomly chosen text with speed and accuracy, displaying real-time WPM and highlighting errors in color! 🎉🖥️

🔑 Key Features:
1.Real-time WPM Calculation 📊: Tracks typing speed dynamically as you type!
2.Error Highlighting ❌✅: Correct characters appear in green, and errors show up in red.
3.Randomized Text Selection 🔄: Each round features a unique challenge selected from text.txt.
4.Interactive Interface 💬: Users can backspace to correct errors, and exit easily with ESC.

🐼Working on this project was such a fun way to strengthen my Python skills and practice real-time user input handling with the curses library! 🎓🔥
✨Would love your thoughts on ways to improve or features to add! 😊
